# Ext.NET Community Archive

This repository contains an archive of Ext.NET Community Edition versions 1.0RC1 - 2.1.1.

The code is from Ext.NET's previously public community repository, as well as archived Ext.NET 
releases I have either kept or found copies of online.

For binaries, please see the [Github **Releases**](https://github.com/pgodwin/Ext.NET.Community/releases) tab above.

## History

Community version of Ext.NET (and previously Coolite) were released under the GNU AGPL 3.0 license (see LICENSE.txt).

However, in March 2013, Ext.NET announced they would no longer be releasing Ext.NET Community updates (see
